# Lessons Learned from Making Resilient Apps with Azure Mobile App Services

Users of mobile apps are just that, mobile. And as such, any mobile app that deals with data needs to work reliably in all environments; from a WiFi connection with a high throughput Internet connection, to an intermittent cell connection that keeps dropping - it even needs to work for prolonged periods of offline use. Not only that, when the device gets back online, your app needs to gracefully handle data synchronization and any data conflicts as well.

In this session, I will share with you hard earned lessons on how to solve the problem of online/offline data resiliency and synchronization using Azure Mobile App Services based on using it in multiple Xamarin projects. You will learn how to solve the issues that arise with improper client-side data schemas, pushing data to the server without knowing when the connection will be interrupted, and reconciling conflicting data between the server and the app. At the end of this session you'll be well equipped to have your app ready for anything.
